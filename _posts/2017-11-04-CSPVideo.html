================
<p>
	At the Theory of Computations course at the Innopolis University I had a task to make a technical report. The assigned topic was about the classical research on Communicating Sequential Processes written by Dr. Tony Hoare.

However, despite its importance for Computer Science, there was no educational video among available materials about it and I decided to fill the gap. The following video is about an extraordinary research paper "Communicating Sequential Processes" by Tony Hoare published in 1978.  <br/><br/>
Enjoy!
